# account_payment_report
Odoo custom report for account payments 


By default there's no direct report print available in accounting -- > Sales or Purchases -- > payments
So this module will add a report button to print account payment reports.


Additional Feature:

This module will also add a copy of payment invoice on the same document with seperating line (------ âœ‚ -----) so that it can be tear out to return back customer receiving copy of payment challan.
